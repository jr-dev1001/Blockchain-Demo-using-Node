# Blockchain-Demo-using-Node
This demonstrate the simple blockchain flow.

This is a simple blockchain demo application built with React and Node. The application allows users to add and delete blocks, demonstrating the basic functionality of a blockchain. And learn about the hash and how does it changes when a new block is added or deleted. Hash that was used is SHA256.

## Features

- **Add Block**: Users can add new blocks to the blockchain by entering data.
- **Delete Block**: Users can delete the last block in the blockchain, except for the Genesis Block.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles errors gracefully, displaying error messages when necessary.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `App.js`: The main React component that renders the blockchain demo interface.
- `backend/main.js`: Contains the `Block` class and the `addBlock` function used to create and add blocks to the blockchain.
- `App.css`: Styles for the application to give it a clean and modern look.
